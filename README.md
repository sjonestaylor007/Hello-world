# Hello-world
Building a staffing app 
and need help with being able to send and recieve messages within the app itself.
I am using Glide but it doesnt have the features i need. What platform should i be using?
Also i need to be able to incorporate a google map into the app that will ping people that are within a 50 mile radius using their current location but not giving that location info out to the sender.  
The whole purpose of the map is to be able to locate the place that is putting in the request for help and show that to whomever is within the 50 mile radius.
